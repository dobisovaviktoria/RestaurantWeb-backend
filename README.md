# Keep Dishes Going
### Viktória Dobišová

## Challenges & Accomplishments

Describe:
- The most significant challenges you encountered during development.

The project was very time-consuming and I implemented everything at least 50 times wrong until I've got the idea what to do. This resulted in me not pushing code as much as I was so embarrassed about the quality. My spaghetti code is still a mess.

Particular examples would be hexagonal architecture and DDD overall and how I had to implement them over and over again to strat with something. My earlier commits (I don't want to think about what was before that) is a good testament.

- The aspects of your project you are most proud of.

That I've managed to do applying all changes to the draft dishes as I had to try several times to make it work and it's not even important feature.

On top of that, the organization of JPA entities is carefully thought of and manually mapped. It is distributed in a sense that both database and domain have their preferred way of storing data without causing any issues.
